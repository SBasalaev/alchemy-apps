This is an example of Ether library.

Library consists of interface and implementation.
The interface defined in 'example.eh' is what can
be used by other programs. The file 'example.e' is
the actual implementation of the library.

This example builds two packages. The first 'libexample1'
contains only the library itself (libexample.1.so).
This package will be installed for programs that use
libexample. The number 1 in the name of the library is
the version of the library interface. If the interface
changes, this number must be increased.

The second package 'libexample-dev' contains files that
are needed to build programs using the library. Namely,
the header file that will be used by program sources and
the link for the compiler to the library implementing
current interface version.
